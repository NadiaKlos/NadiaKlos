💻 I’m currently a 4th year student is Leonard De Vinci Graduate School of Engineering. I have chosen to specialize in Data and Artificial 
Intelligence for my last years of study🚀.
This focus has provided me with the opportunity to delve into all aspects of data management, whether it be extensive or not, from its 
collection and modelling to storage, analysis, and interpretation.📊
Here, you can discover all the projects I'm working on (or have already completed 😎) and those I'm collaborating on.
